In 1970, 127 runners entered the first New York City Marathon. In 2017, the event hosted more than 51,000 runners from all over the country and the world, making it the biggest marathon ever. And one thing is for sure: That’s a lot of hotel reservations.
Luckily, the Big Apple has an inventory of more than 107,000 rooms, about two-thirds of them in Manhattan, the borough with the finish line in Central Park. You can opt for the marathon’s official hotel picks (the Hilton New York and the Sheraton New York), branch out into other sections of Manhattan, or even consider another borough, like Brooklyn or Queens, to give your fan club a less crowded place to cheer you on. (Remember, it’s New York, you’ll be running 26.2 miles: In the words of Old Blue Eyes, do it your way.)
But in considering where to lay your head, weigh prerace travel time to the start line in Fort Wadsworth in Staten Island against your postrace desire to sit down. You may feel more at ease with accommodations super close to the Staten Island Ferry port or Midtown Manhattan bus stop (the two starting line transportation options offered by the race)—or you may decide that a hotel near the finish just makes more sense.
With the help of Heather Cross, NYC travel expert and owner of Vacations By Heather travel agency, we rounded up options that service both desires—plus a bonus recommendation near the course in Harlem that’s great for those wishing to bunk away from the fray (a.k.a. Midtown and Downtown Manhattan). It’s also right near the 22-mile marker of the course, which is when you’ll likely want (read: need) your cheering squad the most. Of course, there are AirBnB and VRBO options, too. Both offer a home-like setting because, you know, the rentals are homes. Our search on both sites showed many still available during marathon weekend. If you’re looking for a super-cheap place and can handle a no-frills bed-and-no-breakfast, check out a hostel.
